Instead, I used Github to upload it to the internet to make me feel like i had a website :). Eventually I will buy a domain name so I can change it to gregsaul.com. Until then I will keep editing and learning to make the website better.</div>
            <div class="col">1/12/23 - This is the first blog post for my blog page. I have been able to make links between pages and done simple formatting. Currently I have only a home page, blog page, and an about me page. I will work to get more functionality soon.</div>
