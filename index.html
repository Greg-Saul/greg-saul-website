            <div class="stack">1/21/23 - On the website today, I changed the way that my blog page looked. It used to have 3 columns and each post had a column. I changed it so that each post has its own row. I like it better this way because it is easier to organize when they were posted. I had to change the class so I could keep my three column styling for my about me page. I am currently working on learning JS so I can have better functionality and style in the site.</div>
            <div class="stack">1/20/23 - Today I got impatient and decided not to finish the website and make it more functional. Instead, I used Github to upload it to the internet to make me feel like I had a real website :). Eventually I will buy a domain name so I can change it to gregsaul.com. Until then I will keep editing and learning to make the website better. I also removed the home page because I had nothing to put on it so the index page is now the blog.</div>
            <div class="stack">1/12/23 - This is the first blog post for my blog page. I have been able to make links between pages and have done simple formatting. Currently I have only a home page, blog page, and an about me page. I will work to get more functionality soon.</div>
